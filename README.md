## **ðŸ”¹ Assignment 2: Socket Programming**  
This assignment focuses on **network programming in Java** using **sockets**. The objective is to implement:  

1. **One-to-One Connection:**  
      A basic **client-server** model where a **single client** connects to a **server** and communicates using sockets.  

2. **One-to-Many Connection:**  
      This program demonstrates a **multi-client server** using **Java Sockets**, where multiple clients can connect, send messages, and have their messages received and displayed by the server.  


### **Technologies Used:**  
- **Java Sockets (ServerSocket, Socket)**
- **I/O Streams (BufferedReader, PrintWriter)**
- **Multi-threading for Handling Multiple Clients**
