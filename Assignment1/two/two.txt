In thsi assignment the Penguin which is a sub class of bird but not inherits all the responsibility of the bird class.

And according to Liskov Substitution , all the functionality , responsibility should be directly inherited by the sub class and should be usable  by all sub class.

for refactoring the code so that it follow the lsp , i made the bird class as abstract and kept only the functionality that all birds can inherit.

and made seprate class for the flying and non flying birds.
now error will not be tere because now subclass inherit things without voilation the principle.
